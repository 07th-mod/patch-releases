## Note for Developers regarding Metalink (.meta4) files

You can use the script at https://github.com/drojf/MetalinkGenerator to generate the metalink files (`.meta4` files)

I don't know if Github lets you atomically update files in a release (eg if replacing files while a user is part-way downloading will cause issues).
